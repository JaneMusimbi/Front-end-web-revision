    <p>Life doesn't always present you with the perfect opportunity at the perfect time<br>
    Opportunities come when you least expert them or when you're not ready for them<br>
    Opportunities, the good ones..are hard to recognize. They're risky and challenge you<br>
    Love what you do and what you love</p>
